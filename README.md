# Urban Ontology

urban.owl.The Urban ontology proposed here as top-level is based on the ODPs, in concrete *Administrative Area* and *City Object* ODPs. In order to reuse existing knowledge, we have aligned our ontology with a set of other existing smart city ontologies in the literature. In addition, the Urban ontology re-uses the concepts related to optimization (algorithms, problems, etc.) defined in BIGOWL ontology. The Urban ontology describes classes and properties for the two use cases in this work: TSP and RND. Nevertheless, the ontology can be updated with new classes in order to define new use cases related to urban domain.

1.	A description of Travel Salesman Problem (TSP).
2.	A description of Radio Network Design Problem (RND).
